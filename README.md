# API for Link Storing website

This repository contains code for REST API created for my project that allows user to create their profile, store their inmportant links, 
update profile photo, update background image on their profile page.

I am using the following stack for backend: 
- **Node JS**
- **ExpressJS**
- **MongoDB**

#### The API is hosted on Render. 

## To run the API on local machine

- Git clone to your machine
  ``` console
  
  git clone https://github.com/abhilashk23/user-login-api.git
  
  ```
